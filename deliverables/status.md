# Week 9 :

### Achieved
- we progressed on the graphs representing the results of scaling tests

### For the following week
- still finalize graphs of scaling tests

### Risks
- None

# Week 8 :

### Achieved
- Group payment functionality finished
- scaling tests and graph reports in process

### For the following week
- finalize results of scaling tests with graphs

### Risks
- None

### Flag

# Week 7 :

### Achieved
- Group payment functionality again in process
- scaling tests also in process

### For the following week
- finalize scaling tests with a representation of the results by graphs
- continue and finalize group payment functionality on the two frontends

### Risks
- same that last week

### Flag
```diff

```

# Week 6 :

### Achieved
- Group payment functionality in process
- scaling tests in process

### For the following week
- continue and finalize scaling tests on our ssh server with Apache Benchmark
- continue and finalize group payment functionality on the two frontends

### Risks
- With the results obtained on the first scaling tests, we now know that our monolithic architecture supports the load 
  and does not need to go into micro-services to achieve the planned functions. 
  We just need to translate these results into a graph so that they are easily understandable.

# Week 5 :

### Achieved
- system architecture diagram updated and available [here](train-booking-components-diagram(latest).png)
- Notification functionality implemented for both web and mobile
- scaling tests in process

### For the following week
- continuing scaling tests on our ssh server with tools like Apache Benchmark
- implement group payment functionality

### Risks
- Modifying our architecture without taking into account scaling tests

### Flag
```diff
+ (Green)
```

# Week 4 :

### Achieved
- The functionalities to be implemented as a priority have been defined
- Choosing to use Firebase for the notification system
- Nothing to change on the architecture for now

### For the following week
- scaling tests on our ssh server with tools like Apache Benchmark
- modify system architecture depending on scaling test results
- Begin the notification functionality for the two frontends (web & mobile synchronised)

### Risks
- Modifying our architecture without taking into account scaling tests

- Web app interfaces (booking & payment) implemented and updated
- Angular frontend connected to the backend
- Backend routes implemented and updated

### For the following week
- Connect mobile app to the backend
- Continuing to implement backend routes and frontend interfaces
- User registration and authentification
- Démo preparation

### Risks
- CI/CD

### Flag
```diff
+ (Green)
```

# Week 43:

### Achieved
- We made new modifications of the component diagram for more details on different machines used, shared online database and more description about shared data between components. The picture of architecture is available [here](train-booking-components-diagram(latest).png).
- Architecture document updated for technical justifications. Available from page 7 of [architecture.pdf](./architecture.pdf) document.
- The backend has been set up and components like CustomerRegistration, TrainSelector and the bank extern are done.
- The flutter mobile app has been set up, and the homepage is in progress
- For Angular, we set up the five first stories (user management and train management)

### For the following week
- implement the two last components in the backend (BookingComponent and PaymentComponent)
- Continuing implement flutter interfaces for reservations and user profile

### Risks
- Integration (communication between all components)
- CI/CD
- Tasks repartition

### Flag
